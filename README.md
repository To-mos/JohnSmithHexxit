JohnSmithHexxit
===============
This is a custom texture pack for Hexxit 1.0.10 based on the John Smith 1.5.2 texture pack for Minecraft.
90% of this pack was and is being hand painted from scratch with wacom tablets and photoshop to maintain the original John Smith look and feel.

Bits of textures from the John Smith Technitian Remix 1.5.2 pack are being touched up and modified for use in little parts of this pack.

Just download a zip of the project and put it into your hexxit/texturepack folder.
