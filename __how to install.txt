JohnSmith Texture Pack - Installation Instructions


1) First of all, you need to Patch Minecraft with the latest "MCPATCHER"

(it will fix ALL the bugs related to "HD" Textures (like Fire on Brick/Gold/Pumpking, water in the Nether, non working compass/clock, etc..) + it will add some cool features)

Download it here:

Run it, leave everything as default but make sure the following options are checked:

-Mods Tab

V HD Font
V Random Mobs
V Custom Colors
V Better Skies

-Options Tab

Water	[custom animated]
Lava	[custom animated]
Fire	[custom animated]

Close Minecraft if it's open and then click "Patch" (in the "Mods" tab)



2) Copy/move the file "johnsmith_V9.7.zip" in the ".Minecraft/texturepacks" folder (dont extract it!)

To find this folder:

launch Minecraft, go to: "Mods and Texture Packs" then click: "Open Texture Pack folder" at the bottom.
Or alternately you can:
click on "Windows Start" > Run (or search) and copy/paste the following then press Enter:

%appdata%/.minecraft/texturepacks



3) Run Minecraft, click "Mods & Texture Pack" and Select "Johnsmith_V9.7.zip"


That's all,


Happy Mining !!
